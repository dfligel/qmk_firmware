# Gherkin Reference Layout

Design Goals/Considerations:

* Provides access to every standard key I could think of
* Provides access to every key without depressing more than 2 keys.
* Instead of using shift to access the !@#$%^&*() etc B and N keys act as modifer to get to the layer that maps to the appropriate key.
    * Example:| QWERTY        | B-MOD         | N-MOD |
              | ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
              | Q             | 1             | !     |
              | W             | 2             | @     |
              | E             | 3             | #     |
* Does __not__ change the layout of the QWERTY alphas. The muscle memory is too strong to screw with!
* Uses the right pinky for single tab space and double tap for enter
* Also handles backspace/del responsibility. The right pinky must be strong!
* Arrow Keys and Functions are handled on a single layer.
